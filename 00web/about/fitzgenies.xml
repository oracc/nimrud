<p>Who are the <esp:techterms term="genie">genies</esp:techterms> on the stairs of the Fitz? Where do they come from and how did they get here? How have they changed in the process, both physically and in the minds of the people who have encountered them?</p>

<p>This lunchtime talk discussed the answers to those questions, and the ways in which knowledge of the ancient past is made and re-made in the light of new evidence, changing theories and current circumstances.</p>
