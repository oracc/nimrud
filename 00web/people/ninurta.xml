<p class="firstpara">Ninurta, god of victory, occupied a <esp:link page="ziggurat">splendid temple</esp:link>
right next to the <esp:link page="northwestpalace">royal
palace</esp:link>. It was one of the first of Kalhu's buildings to be
completed, reflecting this deity's importance for Assyrian
kingship. But as mythical rescuer of the Tablet of Destinies from the
evil Anzu bird, he also had a link to scholarly life. Ninurta may also
be the origin of the modern site-name Nimrud.</p>

<p>In Babylonia, people had worshipped Ninurta since at least the
mid-third millennium BC (<esp:link bookmark="img224"><b>Image 1</b></esp:link>). His main
temple, <esp:glossary term="Ešumeša (place)">Ešumeša</esp:glossary>, was in the Babylonian city of <esp:glossary term="Nippur (place)">Nippur</esp:glossary>. There in the south he
was primarily a deity of agriculture and son of the great god
<esp:glossary term="Ellil (deity)">Ellil</esp:glossary> <esp:ref referent="streck1998-2001"/>,  <esp:ref
referent="wiggermann2011"/>. Many myths and hymns described how he
overcame forces of chaos to bring order, and farming, to the natural
world.</p> 

<p>Three of them were widely copied in Assyria too.</p>

<dd>This <esp:link page="sumerian">Sumerian-language</esp:link> composition recounts Ninurta's defeat of
the <esp:glossary term="Azag (deity)">Azag</esp:glossary> demon and its stone army, with the help of his trusty
mace. The victory enables him to bring about agriculture and to
commission fates for the conquered stones, assigning them roles—for good or
bad—in the world. He returns to his home city of Nippur to great
acclaim and celebration <esp:ref referent="blacketal2004" page="163-180"/>.</dd> 
<dd><i>Ninurta's Exploits</i> is a modern title. In
Sumerian this work was known as <i>Lugale</i>, "O king!", after its
opening word. By Assyrian
times it had acquired a line-by-line <esp:techterms term="Akkadian">Akkadian</esp:techterms> translation, as Sumerian
was considered to be increasingly hard to understand.</dd>

<dt><esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.6.2#"><i>Ninurta's Return
to Nippur</i> (<i>Angim dimma</i>)</esp:link></dt>
<dd>This Sumerian-language companion piece to <i>Ninurta's
Exploits</i> focuses, as the modern title suggests, on the god's
victorious return to his city. It is more a hymn of praise than a
narrative work. Its ancient title, <i>Angim dimma</i>, "Created like
the god An", gives a flavour of the exuberant similes employed. It too
gained an Akkadian translation in the first millennium BC  <esp:ref referent="blacketal2004" page="181-186"/>.</dd>

<dd>This Akkadian-language myth is very similar in structure to
<i>Ninurta's Exploits</i> and, like it and <i>Ninurta's Return</i>, had been in
circulation since at least the early second millennium BC. In three chapters it describes how Ninurta heroically overcomes the evil <esp:glossary term="Anzu (deity)">Anzu bird</esp:glossary>, who has
stolen the gods' <esp:techterms term="Tablet of Destinies">Tablet of
Destinies</esp:techterms> from <esp:glossary term="Ellil (deity)">Ellil</esp:glossary>. Anzu cunningly uses the Tablet of
Destinies' powers over the future to turn back time, disassembling
the god's arrows into their constituent parts. Eventually Ninurta
tricks Anzu into defeat and brings back the Tablet of Destinies to its
rightful owner, to much rejoicing. The composition is described in more detail <esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/scribalapprenticeship/literaryworks/anzu/">on the GKAB project's website</esp:link>.</dd>  
</dl>

<p><i>Anzu</i> in particular resonated with Assyrian <esp:link page="professions">court scholars</esp:link> as it accounted
for the fundamentally negotiable nature of the divinely determined
future. Omens were not predictors of a fixed fate but an advance
warning system of the gods' intentions for Assyria. A well judged
supplication or <esp:link url="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/essentials/lamentationritual/" hide-print="yes" rel="external">lamentation ritual</esp:link> could persuade them to rewrite the
Tablet of Destinies in the empire's favour. Conversely, if events did
not turn out as predicted, then that was because the Tablet had been
altered meanwhile.</p>

<p>For the kings of Assyria, it was the warlike element of Ninurta's
divine personality that was particularly attractive (<esp:link bookmark="img233"><b>Image 2</b></esp:link>). In the late
second millennium BC there was a fashion for
royal names such as Tukulti-Ninurta ("the trusted one of Ninurta"),
Ninurta-apil-Ekur ("Ninurta is the heir of (Ellil's temple) Ekur"),
and Ninurta-tukulti-Aššur ("Ninurta is the god <esp:glossary term="Aššur (deity)">Aššur's</esp:glossary> trusted
one"). <esp:glossary term="Tukulti-Ninurta I (person)">Tukulti-Ninurta I</esp:glossary> hunted fierce wild animals "at the command of
the god Ninurta, who loves me", while <esp:glossary term="Adad-nerari II (person)">Adad-nerari II</esp:glossary> claimed to "act
with the support of Aššur and the god Ninurta, the great gods, his
lords, and (thereby) has felled his foes" <esp:ref
referent="grayson1991" page="25-26, A.0.87.1; 143, A.0.99.1"/>.</p>

<p>When king <esp:link page="assurnasirpal2">Assurnasirpal II</esp:link> moved the Assyrian capital city to
Kalhu, the first temple he built was <esp:link page="ziggurat"
bookmark="ziggurat">for Ninurta</esp:link>. He lined its main rooms
with stone slabs covered in magnificent carvings, including a striking
image of Ninurta defeating the evil Anzu bird. The walls were also inscribed with a long
account of his building works and military victories. Ninurta,
Assurnasirpal says, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>the strong, the almighty,
the exalted, foremost among the gods,
the splendid (and) perfect warrior whose attack in
battle is unequalled, the eldest son who commands
battle (skills), ... king of
battle, the hero who rejoices in battles, the triumphant,
the perfect, lord of springs and seas, the
angry (and) merciless whose attack is a deluge,
the one who overwhelms enemy lands (and) fells
the wicked, the splendid god who never once
changes, light of heaven (and) underworld who illuminates
the interior of the apsû, annihilator of
the evil, subduer of the insubmissive, destroyer of
enemies, the one whose command none of the
gods in the divine assembly can alter, bestower of
life, the compassionate god to whom it is good to
pray <esp:ref referent="grayson1991" page="193-4 A.0.101.1"/>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was left to Assurnasirpal's son <esp:link
page="shalmaneser3">Shalmaneser III</esp:link> to complete Ninurta's <esp:techterms term="ziggurat">ziggurat</esp:techterms>. His son in turn, <esp:glossary term="Šamši-Adad V (person)">Šamši-Adad V</esp:glossary>, dedicated a monumental stone
carving of himself to Ninurta, on which he recounted the military
victories of his first years of rule and even before, when he quashed
a rebellion against his father. None of this would have been possible,
he implies, without Ninurta's support <esp:ref referent="grayson1996"
page="182 A.0.103.1"/>. And when <esp:glossary term="Adad-nerari III (person)">Adad-nerari III</esp:glossary> set up new endowments
for the god Aššur's temple in <esp:glossary term="Assur (place)">Assur</esp:glossary> they were <esp:techterms term="seal, sealing">sealed</esp:techterms> with Ninurta's
seal as well as Aššur's (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa12/P285569,P336283">SAA 12: 1, 71</esp:link>).</p>

<p>The Assyrian kings' move from Kalhu saw a decline in Ninurta's
importance, however. <esp:glossary term="Sargon II (person)">Sargon II</esp:glossary> particularly favoured <esp:link
page="nabu">Nabu</esp:link>. Ninurta still counted amongst the
pantheon of great gods who bestowed blessings &amp; curses, while
<esp:link page="professions"><i>asû</i>-healers</esp:link> blessed the
king on behalf of Ninurta and the healing goddess <esp:glossary
term="Gula (deity)">Gula</esp:glossary> (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa10/corpus/">SAA 10</esp:link>: 314-337). The
(male) <esp:techterms term="prophet(ess)">prophet</esp:techterms> <esp:glossary term="La-dagil-ili (person)">La-dagil-ili</esp:glossary> twice reassured king Esarhaddon that "Your

2</esp:link>). Yet an angry letter from Ninurta to an unknown king
(<b>Image 3</b>) suggests that
he and his priests were not happy with this long-term loss of status (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P336130">SAA 3: 47</esp:link>).</p>

<p>Even if the kings' attention turned from Ninurta in the late eighth
century, the residents of the former capital city remained devoted to
"Ninurta residing in Kalhu", as they called him. <esp:link page="legaldocuments">Legal documents</esp:link>
regularly state that those who break contracts "shall place two minas of <esp:techterms term="silver">silver</esp:techterms> and one mina of <esp:techterms term="gold">gold</esp:techterms> in the lap of Ninurta residing in
Kalhu" (e.g., <esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa06/P335431">SAA 6: 220</esp:link>). The amount of the forfeit varies but it
is paid on top of a tenfold penalty to the other party and, sometimes,
a quantity of tin to the city authorities. The latest known clause
of this type is from 669 BC, the last year of king Esarhaddon's reign (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa14/P336739">SAA 14: 63</esp:link>).</p>

<p>Ninurta's temple in Kalhu continued to flourish right until the end
of empire. It took in the unwanted and the destitute as labourers, as
well as buying specialist artisans such as weavers (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa12/P334997,P335015,P334977">SAA 12: 92-94</esp:link>). Its cultic personnel included a <i>šangû</i>-priest and a chief
singer with support staff including a cook, a steward, and
a porter (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa12/P334997,P335015,P334977,P334976,P335415">SAA 12: 92–96</esp:link>; <esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P334340">SAA 13: 128</esp:link>). In the late seventh century, many of these men witnessed legal documents together with their counterparts at Nabu's temple Ezida, and the two temples shared a <esp:link page="templestaff"><i>qēpu</i>-official</esp:link>.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the city of Kalhu, Ninurta's temple fell to
invaders in the late seventh century BC and was not restored. But his name was never
quite forgotten. In the Book of Genesis (10:8-12), and thus in
Jewish, Christian, and Muslim tradition, he lived on as <esp:glossary term="Nimrod (deity)">Nimrod</esp:glossary> the
mighty hunter  (<esp:link bookmark="img235"><b>Image 4</b></esp:link>). Elsewhere in the Old Testament
a transcription error turned מ (Hebrew M) into ס (S), and ד (D) into ך (K or CH).  Thus Nimrod turned into <esp:glossary term="Nisroch (deity)">Nisroch</esp:glossary>, deity of the
temple in which king <esp:glossary term="Sennacherib (person)">Sennacherib</esp:glossary> was supposed to have been murdered (2
Kings 19:37) <esp:ref referent="toorn-horst1990"/>.</p>

<p>In due course Nimrod, Arabic <i>Namrūd</i>, became the name of the mound under
which Ninurta's city was buried, while the stone winged <esp:techterms
term="genie">genies</esp:techterms> that <esp:glossary term="Layard,
Austen Henry (person)">Layard</esp:glossary> and his
team uncovered in the 1840s were popularly known as "Nisrochs" for
much of the nineteenth century. In <esp:link
rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/837"><i>The Story of the
Amulet</i></esp:link> British author <esp:glossary term="Nesbit, Edith (person)">E. Nesbit</esp:glossary> even has her
child protagonists summon
a Nisroch to help them:</p>
<blockquote><p> 'Walk forward without fear,' said Nisroch. 'Is there aught else that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?'</p>

<p>'No—oh, no,' said Cyril. 'It's all right now. Thanks ever so.'</p>

<p>'You are a dear,' cried Anthea, not in the least knowing what she was saying. 'Oh, thank you thank you. But DO go NOW!'</p>

<p>She caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in hers, like a hand of stone.</p>

<p>'Go forward,' said Nisroch. And they went <esp:ref

<p>Even now the names and martial, macho reputations of Nisroch and Nimrod live on in contexts as
various as <esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUgoBb8m1eE">classical music</esp:link>,
