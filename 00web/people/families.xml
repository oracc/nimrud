	<esp:title>Scholarly families</esp:title>

	<html><head></head><body>
	
<p class="firstpara">Two different <esp:techterms term="scribe">scribal</esp:techterms> families dominated intellectual activity in ancient Kalhu. The Ištaran-šumu-ukin family produced several generations of royal scribes and royal <i>āšipu</i>-healers in the 9th and 8th centuries BC. Members of the Gabbu-ilani-ereš family also served as royal <esp:techterms term="scholar">scholars</esp:techterms>. They became particularly prominent in the late 8th and early 7th century when Nabu-zuqup-kenu and his descendants took many senior roles at court.</p>

<esp:h>Patronage and descent</esp:h>

<p>The king did not issue royal scholars with formal contracts of employment but instead patronised them with gifts and favours in return for their loyalty and expertise. In this way intimate relationships of trust built up, which could be passed on through the family, both from king to <esp:techterms term="crown prince">crown prince</esp:techterms> and from scholar to apprentice. Fathers and uncles trained sons and nephews, not only in the reading and production of learned texts but also in the performance of royal <esp:techterms term="rite, ritual">ritual</esp:techterms> and appropriate conduct at court. Likewise, princes learned from kings which courtly scholars to respect and reward, and which to disfavour or even expel.</p>

<p>In this way, veritable dynasties of scholars dominated Assyrian court circles for generations at a time. We do not know how they first gained favour, or how they fell from grace, but we can track some of their activities through their letters and library <esp:techterms term="tablet">tablets</esp:techterms>.</p>

<esp:h>The descendants of Ištaran-šumu-ukin</esp:h>

<p>About 30 scholarly tablets from <esp:link page="ezida">Ezida</esp:link>, <esp:link page="nabu">Nabu's</esp:link> temple in Kalhu, end with <esp:techterms term="colophon">colophons</esp:techterms>, short notes about who wrote or copied them, and why they did so. These colophons tell us that in the 9th and early 8th century BC, scholarship in Ezida and the royal court was dominated by several generations of the descendants of <esp:glossary term="Ištaran-šumu-ukin (person)">Ištaran-šumu-ukin</esp:glossary>, an <i>āšip šarri</i> (“<esp:link page="professions" bookmark="ashipu">royal exorcist</esp:link>”) who may have lived in the 10th century BC.</p>

<dd>Ištaran-mudammiq was <i>šaggamaḫḫu</i> (“<esp:link page="professions" bookmark="aipuhealer">senior exorcist</esp:link>”) of king <esp:link page="assurnasirpal2">Assurnasirpal II</esp:link>. He was the son of <esp:glossary term="Tappuya (person)">Tappuya</esp:glossary>, a <i>šatammu</i> (“temple administrator”) from the northern Babylonian city of <esp:glossary term="Der (place)">Der</esp:glossary>, and grandson of another <i>šatammu</i>, <esp:glossary term="Huzalu (person)">Huzalu</esp:glossary>.

He was the owner or copyist of a compendium of <esp:techterms term="incantation">incantations</esp:techterms> called <i>Utukkū lemnūtu</i> "Evil demons" (<esp:link url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/P363517" hide-print="yes" rel="external">CTN 4: 103</esp:link>).</dd>

<dd>Ištaran-mudammiq’s great-grandson was the <i>ṭupšar šarri</i> (“royal scribe”) and <i>ummânu</i> (“<esp:link page="professions" bookmark="thekingsseniorscholar">expert/scholar</esp:link>”) of king <esp:glossary term="Adad-nerari III (person)">Adad-nerari III</esp:glossary> (r.  811-783 BC). His father was the <i>āšip šarri</i> <esp:glossary term="Babilayu (person)"><b>Babilayu</b></esp:glossary> son of <esp:glossary term="Nabu-mudammiq (person)">Nabu-mudammiq</esp:glossary> (who may or may not have written <esp:link url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/P363517" hide-print="yes" rel="external">CTN 4: 103</esp:link>, above).

</dl>

<p>Over the generations, this family changed the way they identified their origins. Ištaran-mudammiq presents himself as a newcomer, with roots in the temple administration of the northern Babylonian city of Der. But by his great-grandson’s time the primary ancestor is a royal scholar, the otherwise unattested Ištaran-šumu-ukin. We cannot know whether Ištaran-šumu-ukin was from the same genealogical line as Tappuya and Huzalu, or represents another branch of the family (although his name suggests that he too was from Der). What matters is that by the early 8th century, after four generations of royal service, these scholars saw themselves as always having been royal courtiers.</p>

<p>Sadly, that is all we know for certain about these men, although it is tempting to speculate that Marduk-[...] was involved in the rebuilding of Nabu's temple that took place during the reign of his king Adad-nerari III.</p>

</dl>

<p>Adad-šumu-uṣur and Nabu-zeru-lešir are well known in Assyrian court correspondence from Nineveh, sometimes in collaboration with Urad-Ea and other colleagues. These letters tell us that Adad-šumu-uṣur also worked at Kalhu, where he performed a ritual against two types of fungi that had infested Ezida (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P334243">SAA 13: 71</esp:link>).</p>

<p>Šumaya son of Nabu-zeru-lešir is attested as an <i>āšipu</i> at Nineveh late in Esarhaddon’s reign (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P333969,P334600">SAA 10: 257, 291</esp:link>). Some time in 671–669 BC he petitioned crown prince <esp:link page="assurbanipal">Assurbanipal</esp:link> to let him take over his dead father’s scholarly work at Kalhu, having established himself in a similar role in <esp:glossary term="Tarbiṣu (place)">Tarbiṣu</esp:glossary> (<esp:link url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P334608" hide-print="yes" rel="external">SAA 16: 34</esp:link>). He and Adad-šumu-uṣur witnessed a legal document together in the northern Assyrian town of <esp:glossary term="Ispallure (place)">Ispallure</esp:glossary> in 666 BC (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/saao/saa06/P335359">SAA 6: 314</esp:link>).</p>
<p>One of Adad-šumu-uṣur's sons was the infamous <esp:glossary term="Urad-Gula (person)">Urad-Gula</esp:glossary>, who was expelled from court service as an <i>āšipu</i> never to return, despite his influential father's repeated pleas for clemency (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P334457,P333954,P334829">SAA 10: 224, 226, 294</esp:link>). Perhaps he spent time in Kalhu; we do not know.</p>

<p>The Gabbu-ilani-ereš family disappear from the written record during the reign of Assurbanipal, along with all other court scholars.</p>

<esp:h>A scholar without family</esp:h>

<p>The only other well documented scholar in Nabu's temple conspicuously never mentions his family.</p>

<dt><esp:glossary term="Banunu (person)">Banunu</esp:glossary></dt>
<dd>An <i>āšipu</i>, <esp:glossary term="Banunu (person)">Banunu</esp:glossary> was copyist and/or owner of four scholarly tablets:
<ul>
<li>a prayer of divination “from a Babylonian original” (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/P363476">CTN 4: 61</esp:link>);</li>
<li>the ritual <i>Mīs pî</i>  (“mouth opening”) (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/P363602">CTN 4: 188</esp:link>);</li> 
<li>medical recipes (CTN 4: 188);</li>
<li>and the medical plant list <i>Uruanna</i> (<esp:link hide-print="yes" rel="external" url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/P363606">CTN 4: 192</esp:link>).</li> 
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In the colophons of the second and third of these tablets Banunu exclaims:</p> 

<blockquote><p>Do not disperse the <i>gerginakku</i> ("library"); taboo of <esp:glossary term="Ea (deity)">Ea</esp:glossary>, king of the <esp:techterms term="apsu">Apsu</esp:techterms>!</p></blockquote>
