<p class="firstpara">Several different scholarly professions are attested at the royal court at Kalhu, in literary works, colophons, letters, administrative records and legal documents. The <esp:link bookmark="ummanu"><i>ummânu</i></esp:link> ("chief scribe") was the king's most trusted scholarly advisor. There were also <esp:link bookmark="baru">diviners</esp:link>, <esp:link bookmark="ashipu">healers</esp:link>, and <esp:link bookmark="kalu">lamenters</esp:link>.</p>

<p>The Assyrian king appointed one particularly wise and trustworthy man to be his senior <esp:techterms term="scholar">scholar</esp:techterms>. The literary term for this role was <i>ummânu</i> ("expert") but in more everyday contexts people used the phrases <i>rab ṭupšarri</i> ("chief scribe"), <i>ṭupšar šarri</i> ("king's scribe"), or variants on them.</p>

<p>The father and son Nabu-zeru-lešir and Ištar-šumu-ereš are well known from 7th-century court letters and scholarly writings. They traced
their ancestry back to <esp:glossary term="Gabbu-ilani-ereš (person)">Gabbu-ilani-ereš</esp:glossary>, the very first Assyrian <i>ummânu</i>, who must have moved from <esp:glossary term="Assur (place)">Assur</esp:glossary> to Kalhu with king Assurnasirpal II in the early 9th century. Although the court mainly met in <esp:glossary term="Nineveh (place)">Nineveh</esp:glossary> by this time, the family still had close links to Kalhu.</p>

<p>However, the descendants of <esp:link page="families" bookmark="h_thedescendantsofgabbuilaniere">Gabbu-ilani-ereš</esp:link> did not have a monopoly on the position of <i>ummânu</i>. <esp:techterms term="colophon">Colophons</esp:techterms> on scholarly tablets from Kalhu tell us that other men held that title at some periods of the 8th century BC:</p>

<esp:h><esp:bookmark id="winelists"/>Scholars at court in 8th century Kalhu</esp:h>

<p>About 30 ration lists of bread and wine found in <esp:link page="fortshalmaneser">Fort Shalmaneser</esp:link> (the so-called <esp:techterms term="Nimrud Wine Lists">Nimrud Wine Lists</esp:techterms>) date from the reigns of <esp:glossary term="Adad-nerari III (person)">Adad-nerari III</esp:glossary> and <esp:glossary term="Tiglath-pileser III (person)">Tiglath-pileser III</esp:glossary>. It is still disputed whether these texts represent regular allocations to court personnel and visiting dignitaries or extra distributions on special occasions. Either way, because they list the recipients in order of importance, they give us a glimpse into palace hierarchies in the 8th century BC.</p> 

<p>On this evidence, perhaps surprisingly, it seems that the king did not hold his regular court scholars in particularly high regard (<esp:link bookmark="img242"><b>Image 2</b></esp:link>). Rather, he gave pride of place to the <i>dāgil iṣṣūrī</i> (<esp:techterms term="augur">"augurs"</esp:techterms>), from Assyria’s northwestern <esp:techterms term="vassal">vassal</esp:techterms> and close ally <esp:glossary term="Commagene (place)">Commagene</esp:glossary>. These augurs divined the future from observing the flights of birds following a long-standing Syro-<esp:glossary term="Anatolia (place)">Anatolian</esp:glossary> tradition. As Karen Radner argues, they were quite likely diplomatic visitors or long-term envoys and may have participated in an annual spring festival for the storm-god <esp:glossary term="Adad (deity)">Adad</esp:glossary> <esp:ref referent="radner2009" page="231–233"/>.</p>  

<p>Local scholars came much further down the lists of bread and wine given out on such occasions, and were never named in person. The
 <esp:link bookmark="baru"><i>bārû</i></esp:link>-<esp:techterms term="diviner">diviners</esp:techterms>  - once or twice described as <i>kaššaya</i> ("Kassite" or Babylonian) - always preceeded the <esp:link bookmark="ashipu"><i>āšipu</i></esp:link>-healers and the <esp:link bookmark="asu"><i>asû</i></esp:link>-healers usually ranked bottom. Now and again, though, the <i>rab asî</i> ("chief <i>asû</i>-healer") headed the group of scholars.</p>

<p>The Assyrian word <i>āšipu</i> is often translated <esp:techterms term="exorcist">"exorcist"</esp:techterms> but this unhappy term does not capture the range and importance of this profession's work.

<p>The profession of <i>āšip šarri</i> ("king's healer") is attested at Kalhu from the ninth to the seventh centuries BC. For the early

<p>This location continued to be closely linked to royal <i>āšipus</i> in the early 7th century BC. However, by that time, the Gabbu-ilani-ereš family had taken over.

We should be wary of this designation, though. They did not cast horoscopes (and could not have done, centuries before the invention of the zodiac). Nor were they concerned only with the night sky.

<p>We know of no <i>ṭupšar Enūma Anu Ellil</i> active at Kalhu in the 9th or 8th centuries BC. In the 7th century (when we have the richest evidence), kings Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal received reports from many central Assyrian and northern Babylonian cities. Many of the men who sent these omen reports to the king were also engaged in other scholarly activities. It is likely, then, that  <i>ṭupšar Enūma Anu Ellil</i> was not a primary professional designation but a secondary role that scholars played.</p>

<p>However, as we have seen from the Nimrud Wine Lists, both Assyrian and Babylonian <i>bārûs</i> were allocated wine for court feasts at that time. </p>

<p>In the early 7th century BC, Esarhaddon had some <i>bārûtu</i>-divinations carried out at Kalhu (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes"
url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/P238987,P336279">SAA 4: 122, 183</esp:link>).</p>

<p>No works of <i>bārûtu</i> - the art of the diviner - survive in the Kalhu Ezida. Given their professional segregation it is unlikely that <i>bārû</i>-diviners were ever closely involved with Nabu's temple.</p>

<esp:h><esp:bookmark id="kalu"/><i>kalû</i>-lamenters</esp:h>

<p>The lamenter's role was to respond to negative omens or other divine messages, through ritual acts of penitence on behalf of the king. They often worked in collaboration with <i>āšipus</i> and <i>ṭupšar Enūma Anu Ellil</i>, at least in 7th century Nineveh. We don't know much about their activities in Kalhu, however, because as temple personnel, they came to the king’s attention only when they were misbehaving.</p>

<p>Lamenters were not part of the courtly retinue that received wine rations in the 8th century BC. Nor, so far as we know, did they write scholarly tablets for Ezida — unless we count <esp:glossary term="Nabu-leʾi (person)"><b>Nabu-leʾi</b></esp:glossary> (professional title unknown), son of the lamenter <esp:glossary term="Urad-Ea (person)">Urad-Ea</esp:glossary> (<esp:link rel="external" hide-print="yes" url="http://oracc.org/cams/gkab/P363601">CTN 4: 187</esp:link>).</p>
