<p class="firstpara">The Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III is a stone monument that celebrates thirty-one successful years of military campaigns by king <esp:link page="shalmaneser3">Shalmaneser III</esp:link> and his chief minister, <esp:link page="shalmaneser3" bookmark="dayyan-assur">Dayyan-Aššur</esp:link>. It was erected in 825 BC in a courtyard of a central building in Kalhu. Carved into its four faces are scenes showing king Shalmaneser III receiving <esp:techterms term="tribute">tribute</esp:techterms> from <esp:techterms term="vassal">vassal</esp:techterms> subjects across the Assyrian empire. After its rediscovery in 1846, the Obelisk <esp:link page="obeliskdiscovery">became a museum object in London</esp:link>, and gained fame for depicting an Israelite king mentioned in the Christian Bible.</p>

<p>The Black Obelisk (<b>Image 1</b>) is a monument (or <esp:techterms term="stela, stele">stela</esp:techterms>) carved from black limestone, which stands just under two metres high. It has four sides, each 45 cm wide. The top is stepped as though shaped like a  <esp:techterms term="ziggurat">ziggurat</esp:techterms> with four sloping stages. The significance of this shape is unknown, but it does seem to be standard for Assyrian <esp:techterms term="obelisk">obelisks</esp:techterms>. <esp:link url="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/the_white_obelisk.aspx" rel="external" hide-print="yes">The White Obelisk of Assurnasirpal I</esp:link> found by <esp:link url="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/h/hormuzd_rassam_1826-1910.aspx" rel="external" hide-print="yes">Hormuzd Rassam</esp:link> at Nineveh shares this shape.</p>

<p>The function of obelisks is not certain, but judging from its four faces, and its <esp:techterms term="findspot">findspot</esp:techterms>, it is reasonable to conclude that it was designed for public display. The Black Obelisk  (<b>Image 1</b>) was erected in a courtyard outside a large building in the centre of Kalhu, now known as the "Central Building", which is thought to be one of the temples listed in <esp:link page="assurnasirpal2">Assurnasirpal II's</esp:link> <esp:link page="sia-intro">Standard Inscription</esp:link> <esp:ref referent="oatesoates2001" page="71-73"/>. At the time of the <esp:techterms term="stela, stele">stela's</esp:techterms> erection, Kalhu was the capital of an Assyrian empire torn apart by civil war, so maybe it was intended to remind the king's retinue of the extent of his authority and rule.</p>

<esp:h>Acts of tribute to the Assyrian king</esp:h>

<p>Five scenes wrap around the Obelisk. They each depict <esp:techterms term="tribute">tribute</esp:techterms> exacted from a <esp:techterms term="vassal">vassal</esp:techterms>, who is named in a <esp:techterms term="cuneiform">cuneiform</esp:techterms> caption. The tribute includes exotic animals such as camels, monkeys, an elephant and a rhinoceros. Assyrian kings often collected exotic animals and plants as an expression of their power. It is thought that the vassals shown here are chosen to demonstrate the geographical bounds of the empire, from east to west. The Black Obelisk also has a longer inscription, which tells of Shalmaneser's achievements in more detail <esp:ref referent="grayson1996" page="62-71: A.0.102.14 (with detailed bibliography), pp.148-51: A.0.102.87-91"/>.</p> 

<p>The five tribute scenes as they wrap around the monument are as follows, from top to bottom:</p>

<ul><li>Side A: Attendants bring "tribute from Muṣri: two-humped camels". Muṣri, meaning 'borderland', probably refers to a country far to the east.</li>
<li>Side B: Exotic animals from Muṣri: "a river-ox [water-buffalo], an [Indian] rhinoceros (and) an antelope". The sculptor seems never to have seen a rhinoceros.</li>
<li>Side C: "Female [Indian] elephants, female monkeys (and) apes" from Muṣri.</li>
<li>Side D: More "monkeys" and their keepers from Muṣri. The way the monkeys are carved suggests that the sculptor had not seen them himself. This may not be the case, however. Monkeys were not new sights for the Assyrian court at this time. </li>
