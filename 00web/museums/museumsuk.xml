<p>The British Museum's collection of artefacts from Nimrud is world-famous and has shaped the image of Assyria in public imagination since the mid-19th century. Among the artefacts discovered by Austen Henry Layard's expedition between 1845-7 and 1849-51 are around 65 <esp:link url="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/s/stone_panel,_north-west_palace.aspx" title="Stone relief from the North-West Palace showing tribute bearers">stone relief panels</esp:link> from the <esp:link url="northwestpalace">Northwest Palace</esp:link> of king <esp:glossary term="Assurnasirpal II (person)">Assurnasirpal II</esp:glossary>, bearing the king's inscription and protective imagery.

Another object that shot to fame was the <esp:link page="obelisk">Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III</esp:link>, due to its connections to the Christian Bible. This two-metre tall stone monument depicts Biblical king Jehu bringing tribute to the Assyrian ruler - an event that is not mentioned in the Bible itself.</p>

<p>In addition to famous 19th-century discoveries, the British Museum holds the UK's largest collection of artefacts from 1950s excavations by the <esp:techterms term="British School of Archaeology in Iraq">British School of Archaeology in Iraq</esp:techterms>. The collection of around 2300 artefacts includes corpora of <esp:link page="materials-clay">cuneiform texts written on clay tablets</esp:link> and other types inscribed objects, such as <esp:link page="materials-others">weights, architectural fittings and writing boards</esp:link>.</p>

After a review of the ivories in c.2012, Ipswich Museum decided that these artefacts should be transferred to the British Museum where they could be better appreciated in the context of the wider Nimrud collection. The transfer of the 3 ivories was completed in January 2014 and Ipswich Museum continues to work in partnership with the British Museum.</p>
