<p class="firstpara"><esp:techterms term="cuneiform">Cuneiform</esp:techterms> was usually written on clay, but it was also recorded on stone, metal, wax-filled wooden writing boards, and could even be inked onto clay. The <esp:techterms term="Aramaic">Aramaic</esp:techterms> alphabet was also used sometimes alongside or instead of cuneiform, inked on or scratched into clay. These materials and techniques were used to create different types of texts, from <esp:link page="inscriptions">royal inscriptions</esp:link> and <esp:link page="scholarlyworks">scholarly texts</esp:link> to letters and  <esp:link page="legaldocuments">legal documents</esp:link>. Each type of text had its own characteristics.</p>

<p><!--MOVE-->Stone and metal were more resilient against damage than clay, and also more expensive. They were used particularly for <esp:techterms term="votive">votive</esp:techterms> or monumental inscriptions.</p> 

<p>Palace walls were covered in <esp:techterms term="bas-relief">reliefs</esp:techterms> with magical functions or illustrating victorious campaigns. Cuneiform texts could be carved around, or over, them in large letters. The <esp:link page="sia-intro">Standard Inscription of Assurnasirpal II</esp:link> is a good example. Sometimes the scenes would be labelled with a caption, spelling out the name of the city being captured, for example. It seems likely that a <esp:techterms term="scribe">scribe</esp:techterms> first drew the outline of the cuneiform signs in ink, and a stonecutter then carved them out. The deeds and prayers of the king could also be inscribed on statues and monuments like the <esp:link page="obelisk">Black Obelisk</esp:link>.</p>

<p>A wide range of other artefacts were inscribed with text, such as <esp:techterms term="votive">votive</esp:techterms> objects, weights and <esp:techterms term="amulet">amulets</esp:techterms>. Weights were made from metal, often in the shape of a crouching lion, which was a symbol of kingship in Assyria (<b>Image 2</b>). Weights could be labelled in <esp:techterms term="Akkadian">Akkadian</esp:techterms> cuneiform or the <esp:link page="alphabetic">Aramaic alphabet</esp:link>. Another traditional weight form, dating back many centuries, was a duck carved from stone.</p>

<p> From around the late 3rd millenium BC onwards, scribes sometimes wrote cuneiform on <esp:techterms term="writing board">writing boards</esp:techterms>. Wooden or <esp:techterms term="ivory">ivory</esp:techterms> boards were filled with a layer of softened wax, which could then be inscribed in the same way as a clay <esp:techterms term="tablet">tablet</esp:techterms>. Two or more leaves were bound and folded together, protecting the inscription inside (<b>Image 3</b>). Remarkably, a few boards survive today. They had been thrown down a well, perhaps during the destruction of Kalhu in 612 BC. Cuneiform texts on clay tablets tell us that boards were once common.</p>

<p>Writing boards were used for both administrative and scholarly purposes. Assyrian palace <esp:techterms term="relief">reliefs</esp:techterms> show them in use on campaign (<b>Image 4</b>). Scribes are shown in pairs, one writing in cuneiform on a board or a tablet, the other writing in Aramaic on a leather scroll. <esp:link page="materials-clay" bookmark="tablet_making">Tablet making</esp:link> was a skilled task. The logistics of sourcing, producing and maintaining a tablet whilst away from the facilities of the workplace may have proved more awkward than using a writing board. </p>

<esp:h>Writing cuneiform in ink</esp:h>

<p>Cuneiform could occasionally be written in ink, paint, or glaze although it is not well suited to this technique. To form a <esp:techterms term="wedge">wedge</esp:techterms> in clay takes a single stroke; writing one in a liquid medium takes three strokes, drawing the three sides of the triangular outline.</p>

<p>At Nimrud cuneiform inscriptions are found on wall <esp:techterms term="plaque">plaques</esp:techterms> that decorated the <esp:link page="ziggurat" bookmark="temple_of_kidmuru">temple of Ištar, mistress of the Kidmuru</esp:link>. They were glazed with multicoloured designs and a short inscription (<b>Images 5, 6</b>).</p>

<p>Ink had long been used by cuneiform scribes for various purposes. Scribes working in the royal city of Nineveh in the 7th century sometimes wrote the <esp:techterms term="colophon">colophons</esp:techterms> to library tablets in ink. It was much more commonly used for writing <esp:link page="alphabetic">Aramaic</esp:link>.</p>
