	<esp:title>Writing cuneiform on clay</esp:title>

<p class="firstpara"><esp:techterms term="cuneiform">Cuneiform</esp:techterms> is designed to be written on clay. The wedge-shaped impressions that give cuneiform its modern name are made by pressing a <esp:techterms term="stylus">stylus</esp:techterms> into the surface of a moist clay <esp:techterms term="tablet">tablet</esp:techterms>. The stylus is then lifted back up ready to make the next impression, rather than dragged across the surface as we would use a pen. Some tablets were enclosed within a clay envelope. And tablets or envelopes were sometimes stamped or sealed. There are strong connections between a language, the writing system in which it is written, the medium on which it is usually written and the technique of writing. The <esp:link page="sumerian">Sumerian</esp:link> and <esp:link url="http://oracc.org/saao/knpp/cuneiformrevealed/akkadianlanguage/Akkadian" rel="external" hide-print="yes">Akkadian</esp:link> languages were typically written in cuneiform script on clay but were also sometimes <esp:link page="materials-others">written on other media</esp:link>.</p>

<p>Most cuneiform inscriptions were written on clay tablets. Scribes used different shapes and sizes of tablet for different purposes, but made most of them to fit comfortably in the hand. The <esp:link page="vte-intro">Succession Treaties</esp:link> of <esp:glossary term="Esarhaddon (person)">Esarhaddon</esp:glossary> are written on unusually large and thick tablets. We can identify various types of clay, some containing stones or shells, others with very few <esp:techterms term="inclusion">inclusions</esp:techterms>. This is similar to our use of different sizes and qualities of paper for newspapers, letters and post-it notes.</p>

<p>Clay could also be formed into other shapes for special purposes. Assyrian kings of the first millennium BC had their <esp:link page="inscriptions">inscriptions</esp:link> written on a variety of objects: tablets, cones, bricks, prisms and cylinders. They discussed the exact text of each inscription with the scribe, and carefully chose the objects thems as well. Two popular types of object chosen to carry royal inscriptions were prisms and cylinders. The size and shape of these varies from one ruler to the next (<b>Image 2</b>). We even find royal  inscriptions on <esp:techterms term="clay hand">architectural fittings in the shape of hands</esp:techterms> (<b>Image 1</b>).</p>

<p>Scribes also chose certain shapes and sizes for each of the different types of text from daily life. They sometimes wrote <esp:link page="legaldocuments" bookmark="loan dockets">loans of barley</esp:link> on triangular <esp:techterms term="docket">dockets</esp:techterms>.

The more ephemeral contracts (for things such as loans) meanwhile are smaller, <esp:techterms term="landscape format">landscape format</esp:techterms> tablets, with envelopes. The scribe sealed the envelope but not the table. A typical letter would be portrait format, but thinner than a conveyance and not sealed. <esp:link page="scholarlyworks">Scholarly tablets</esp:link> are often written in portrait orientation, in one or two columns. <b>Image 3</b> shows some common tablet types from Nimrud.</p>

<esp:h>Working with clay</esp:h>

<p>Clay for making tablets was readily available from rivers. So too were reeds for making a stylus. The clay for tablets could first be processed to remove stones and plant matter. This did not always happen, however, and many tablets contain such <esp:techterms term="inclusion">inclusions</esp:techterms> (<b>Image 4</b>). Indeed, tablets from Nimrud contain inclusions much more often than those from <esp:glossary term="Nineveh (place)">Nineveh</esp:glossary>, for example.</p>

<p><esp:techterms term="Assyriology">Assyriologist</esp:techterms> Henry Saggs tested the clays of tablets from Nimrud <esp:ref referent="saggs2001" page="2"/>. He found that tablets originally from <esp:glossary term="Babylonia (place)">Babylonia</esp:glossary> contained a higher level of <esp:techterms term="lime">lime</esp:techterms> than their Assyrian counterparts. This made them softer, and less likely to suffer cracking, but more susceptible to damage from salts coming to the surface and breaking off text as they crystallised.</p>

Despite their name, the exact function of these holes is not known.

<p>Most tablets were not fired in antiquity. Left to dry in the air (preferably not in the sun, which dries them too quickly), tablets become hard enough to withstand normal handling and storage. This means that they could potentially be recycled by soaking the clay in water, although in many cases old tablets were simply discarded. Tablets intended to survive for very long periods could be fired. Such tablets sometimes contain what Assyriologists call “firing holes”, the actual function of which was probably not to assist in the firing process, however (<b>Image 5</b>).</p>

<p>Many tablets survive only in broken condition. While this obviously means that we have lost some of the text, it does sometimes allow us to see how the tablet was made. Often we can see that the <esp:techterms term="scribe">scribe</esp:techterms> had rolled a sheet of clay into the tablet shape (<b>Image 6</b>). Another technique saw a skin of fine clay wrapped around a core of rougher clay (<b>Image 7</b>).</p>

<esp:h>Sealing</esp:h>

<p>People had long used seals to confirm identity or indicate authority. The <esp:link page="vte-intro">Succession Treaties of Esarhaddon</esp:link> are sealed with no fewer than <esp:link page="vte-detail" bookmark="seal impressions">three cylinder seals</esp:link>. During the <esp:techterms term="Neo-Assyrian">Neo-Assyrian</esp:techterms> period, old-fashioned cylinder seals gave way to <esp:link page="legaldocuments" bookmark="img126">stamp seals</esp:link>. Instead of being rolled across the surface, a stamp seal was simply impressed into the clay. Sometimes people kept an old cylinder seal, and used it as though it were a stamp seal.</p>

<p>Another method of sealing was to use a fingernail. One example of a tablet sealed using this method is a <esp:link page="legaldocuments" bookmark="img127">legal document bearing the impressions of men's fingernails</esp:link> “instead of their seal”, to certify that debts owed to them have been repaid. Some historians have suggested that some fingernail impressions were made with a special tool.</p> 

<esp:h>Enveloping</esp:h>

<p>There was a very long tradition in Mesopotamia of enclosing texts within <esp:link page="legaldocuments" bookmark="img128">protective envelopes</esp:link>. Like a modern envelope, the Assyrian type was made from a folded sheet (although in this case made of clay rather than paper). In the case of a letter, the scribe wrote the name of both sender and recipient on the envelope, together with a short greeting and a seal impression to confirm the sender’s identity. Few envelopes survive, because the act of opening them meant breaking them; the broken pieces would then be discarded.</p> 

<esp:h><esp:bookmark id="stylus" title="stylus">Stylus</esp:bookmark></esp:h>

<p>The Akkadian word for stylus is <i>qān ṭuppi</i>, which literally means “tablet reed”. Reed was a natural and very suitable material for a stylus. We can sometimes see traces of the fibres of the reed in the <esp:techterms term="wedge">wedges</esp:techterms> of cuneiform. Wood, bone and other materials could also be used. No original Assyrian styluses survive.</p> 

<esp:h>Storage</esp:h>

<esp:image file="langscripts/filing.jpg" description="Excavated room within the temple of the god Nabu at Nimrud" position="float"><esp:caption><esp:bookmark id="img129"><b>Image 8</b>: An Assyrian filing cabinet?

<p>Mesopotamian scribes stored their tablets in jars, bags, or on shelves. Max Mallowan, who excavated in Nimrud in the 1950s, suggested that the feature in archive room ZT 4 of the <esp:link page="northwestpalace">Northwest Palace</esp:link> should be interpreted as a filing cabinet for tablets (<b>Image 8</b>).</p>
